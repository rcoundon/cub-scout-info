## Task Assignment Recommendations

### Critical Path Tasks (Must Complete First)
1. Project setup and infrastructure
2. Database design and setup
3. Authentication system
4. Core Events API
5. Core frontend pages
6. Deployment infrastructure

### Parallel Work Streams
- **Backend Team**: API development, database, authentication
- **Frontend Team**: UI components, pages, integration
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring

### Dependencies
- Frontend work depends on API endpoints being available
- Deployment depends on both frontend and backend completion
- Testing can begin once features are partially complete
- Documentation can be written alongside development

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 4 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 1 week
- **Phase 5**: 1 week
- **Phase 6**: 1 week
- **Total**: 12 weeks to launch

*Note: Timeline assumes 1-2 developers working part-time. Adjust based on available resources.*
